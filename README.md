Chimera: Chiral Measures Research Assistant
===========================================

© Emilio Pisanty & Margarita Khokhlova, 2026

Chimera (Chiral Measures Research Assistant) is a Wolfram Mathematica package which contains code and tools useful to quantify the chirality of a distribution, and to apply those tools to photoelectron momentum spectra, such as might be obtained from strong-field ionization of chiral molecules, or of achiral systems driven by chiral fields.

The formalism and an outline of the software tools are described in the paper

 - Chiral moments make chiral measures. Emilio Pisanty, Nicola Mayer, Andrés Ordóñez, Alexander Löhr and Margarita Khokhlova (author list to be confirmed). In preparation (2026).

The package and its documentation are currently in the process of being finalized for initial release. If you find any of these tools interesting, please get in touch!
